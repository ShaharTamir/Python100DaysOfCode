Write a function that will work with the following 
line of code to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log:

add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
You've visited Russia 2 times.

You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.
